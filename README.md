# test-action

* Some playing around for the first time with github actions
* Now I have my workflow, and now?
* Manual installation of pandoc and creation of PDF...
* Better use the content of the repo : https://github.com/jogi-k/pandoc-action-example
* And merge it with the content of : https://github.com/jogi-k/ftp-test
* And apply it to : https://github.com/jogi-k/CalliopeMini-ProgrammierenLernen
* That's the idea...
